## Documentation
The build process is tedious and questionably non-trivial.

1. Work in your browser (suggested tools are [serve][] and [livereload][] for quick setup and iteration respectively)
2. Enable a high constract background (e.g. `#F0F`)
3. Take a screenshot of the image (suggested tool is [screenshot-as-a-service][screenshot])
4. Crop and remove high contrast background from screenshot (suggested tool is [pixlr][])
5. [Disco!][pulp-fiction]
